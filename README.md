# Deep-Learning

**Overview**

This repository contains implementations of fundamental deep learning concepts as part of the Deep Learning Lab Module 1. The notebook includes experiments related to single artificial neurons and perceptrons, focusing on binary classification tasks.

**Experiments Included**

Experiment 1: Implementation of a Single Artificial Neuron
- Simulates a single neuron performing binary classification.
- Uses sigmoid activation and gradient descent for weight updates.

Experiment 2: Implementation of a Single Layer Perceptron (SLP)
- Trains and tests a Perceptron model on a linearly separable dataset (e.g., AND/OR gate).
- Implements basic perceptron learning algorithm with weight and bias updates.

**Results**
- The single artificial neuron and perceptron models are tested on basic logical gate datasets (AND, OR).
- The models successfully learn and classify the input data correctly.
